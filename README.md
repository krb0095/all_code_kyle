This github repository is a collection of all the code I have used over my career. I will try to keep this page updated as much as I can, and feel free to reach out if you so choose. The README.md give a brief break down of the codes, files, and directories here. I am in the process of ensuring all of the python codes are PIP3 format and that all other codes are as clear as possible but this will take some time.
